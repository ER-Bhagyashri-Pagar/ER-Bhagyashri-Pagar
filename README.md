I'm a passionate Software Engineer and graduate student at Northeastern University, building intelligent systems that solve real-world problems. From architecting scalable microservices to developing advanced RAG systems, I thrive on transforming complex challenges into elegant solutions.

## üöÄ About Me

Hello! I'm an Information Technology engineer fueled by a profound curiosity for technology and innovation. Currently pursuing my Master of Science in Information Systems at Northeastern University (GPA: 3.85/4.00), I am dedicated to mastering new skills and crafting impactful solutions in the ever-evolving tech landscape.

As a Full Stack Engineer with experience at Sunanda Infotech, I've engineered applications that improved page load times by 35% and reduced API response times by 40%. My technical journey spans from architecting scalable microservices with Java Spring Boot to developing intelligent RAG systems with 96% reduction in document fragmentation.

What truly sets me apart is my ability to blend technical expertise with creative problem-solving ‚Äì whether I'm developing predictive models that improve forecasting accuracy by 20% or designing CNN-based deep learning models that achieve 92% accuracy for sign language recognition.

> "I don't just write code ‚Äì I architect solutions that bridge the gap between complex business challenges and cutting-edge technology."
